## Correlation Analysis:
To understand the relationship between market capitalization and quarterly sales for these top 10 companies, the Pearson correlation coefficient can be calculated. This coefficient quantifies the linear relationship between the two variables, where:

A positive correlation indicates that as market capitalization increases, quarterly sales tend to increase.
A negative correlation would suggest an inverse relationship.
A coefficient close to zero indicates little to no linear relationship.
Findings:
Typically, we expect to see a positive correlation between market capitalization and quarterly sales among the top companies, as larger market cap often reflects higher sales performance. This analysis will help management understand how market value aligns with sales performance and identify areas for strategic improvements.
